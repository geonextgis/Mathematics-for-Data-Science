        "Key concepts in inferential statistics include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hypothesis Testing:** This involves making a statistical inference about a population parameter based on sample data. Researchers formulate a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, collect data, and use statistical tests to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Confidence Intervals:** Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval indicates that we are 95% confident that the true parameter falls within the specified range.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Regression Analysis:** This statistical method is used to study the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It helps in predicting or estimating the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",

        "4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** ANOVA is a statistical technique used to compare means among different groups. It assesses whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Sampling Techniques:** Since inferential statistics involve making inferences about a population based on a sample, it's crucial to use appropriate sampling techniques to ensure the sample is representative of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Chi-square tests:** This involves testing the independence or association between two\n",
        "categorical variables. For example, testing whether gender and occupation are\n",
        "independent variables.\n",
        "\n",

        "updating the probability of a disease given a positive test result."

        "1. **Categorical Data (Qualitative Data):**\n",
        "   - **Nominal Data:** This type of data consists of categories or labels without any inherent order or ranking. Examples include colors, gender, or types of fruit. Nominal data can be represented by words or numbers, but the numerical values do not imply any inherent order.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Ordinal Data:** Ordinal data has categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the categories are not uniform or meaningful. Examples include education levels, socio-economic status, or customer satisfaction ratings on a scale from \"low\" to \"high.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Numerical Data (Quantitative Data):**\n",
        "   - **Discrete Data:** Discrete data consists of separate, distinct values that are often counted in whole numbers. Examples include the number of students in a class, the count of cars in a parking lot, or the number of books on a shelf.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Continuous Data:** Continuous data can take any value within a given range and can be measured with great precision. Examples include height, weight, temperature, or time. Continuous data is often represented using real numbers and can be measured with decimal values.\n",
